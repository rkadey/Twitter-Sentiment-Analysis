# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
## Introduction
Prior to winning the seat of goverment in 2016, the then Presidential Candidate in the person of Nana Addo Dankwah for the New Patriotic Party (NPP) made a promise to build a Cathedral to honor God should he be voted by Ghanaians as their president. Fast forward to 2022, the goverment of Ghana under the leadership of His Excellency has generated a lot of debate online with the execution of the National Cathedral.

This project seeks to analyse the sentiments of twitter users on the building of the National Cathedral.
