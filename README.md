# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
## Introduction
Prior to winning the seat of goverment in 2016, the then Presidential Candidate in the person of Nana Akuffo-Addo for the New Patriotic Party (NPP) made a promise to build a Cathedral to honor God should he be voted by Ghanaians as their president. Fast forward to 2022, the goverment of Ghana under the leadership of His Excellency has generated a lot of debate online with the execution of the National Cathedral.

This project seeks to analyse the sentiments of twitter users on the building of the National Cathedral.

### Data Mining
Our data for the project was mined from twitter with a sample size of 50,000 tweets. Python library snscrape.modules was imported to help with the mining. I queried tweets of Nationa Cathedral from 01 January 2018 to 07 July 2022. The data was loaded into my jupyter notebook and stored in a pandas dataframe named Data.
